            "1. What generally constitutes an offer in contract law?",
            "An offer is an expression of willingness by one party to contract on specified terms, with the intention that it will become binding as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it's addressed."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "2. What is an invitation to treat in contract law?",
            "An invitation to treat is an expression of willingness to negotiate a deal, not an offer. It invites others to make offers or enter negotiations."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "3. How is an offer different from an advertisement?",
            "Typically, advertisements are considered invitations to treat, meaning they invite people to make offers rather than being offers themselves. An exception is when the advertisement is for a unilateral contract, such as a reward (e.g., Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co)."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "4. What is required for acceptance of an offer?",
            "Acceptance must be an unqualified expression of assent to the terms of the offer. It can be communicated through words, actions, or performance, depending on the offer's conditions."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "5. Can silence be used as a form of acceptance in contract law?",
            "Generally, silence cannot constitute acceptance of an offer. Acceptance must be communicated explicitly unless the offer explicitly states otherwise."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "6. What is the 'Postal Rule' in contract law?",
            "The Postal Rule states that acceptance is effective as soon as the letter of acceptance is posted, even if it never reaches the offeror."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "7. How can an offer be terminated?",
            "An offer can be terminated by rejection, revocation (withdrawal of the offer), lapse of time, failure of a precondition, or death of the offeror."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "8. What is a counter-offer and its effect on the original offer?",
            "A counter-offer introduces new terms to the negotiation, effectively rejecting the original offer and putting a new offer in its place."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "9. What role does communication play in the acceptance of an offer?",
            "Acceptance must generally be communicated to the offeror to create a binding contract, unless specific exceptions apply (such as the Postal Rule)."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "10. What distinguishes a unilateral contract from a bilateral contract?",
            "In a unilateral contract, one party promises a reward in exchange for the performance of a specified act by another. In a bilateral contract, both parties exchange promises to perform certain acts."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "11. What is the effect of a counter-offer on the original offer?",
            "A counter-offer terminates the original offer, as it implies rejection of the original terms and proposes new ones."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "12. How is acceptance handled in unilateral contracts?",
            " In unilateral contracts, acceptance is usually performed by completing the act required by the offeror, without needing to communicate the intention to accept before performing the act."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "13. Can an offer be revoked after acceptance has started in a unilateral contract?",
            "No, once the performance of the act required in a unilateral contract has begun, the offer cannot be revoked."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "14. What is the role of intention in forming a contract?",
            "The intention to create legal relations is essential. Both parties must intend for their agreement to be legally binding."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "15. How does death affect an ongoing contract negotiation?",
            "If either the offeror or the offeree dies before acceptance, the offer typically lapses, unless the contract is impersonal in nature and could still be completed by representatives of the deceased."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "16. What happens if an offeree accepts an offer not knowing it has been withdrawn?",
            "If an offeree accepts an offer without knowing it has been validly revoked, there is no contract because a valid revocation terminates the offer before acceptance."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "17. What is considered a reasonable time for an offer to remain open if no time limit is specified?",
            "A reasonable time is subjective and depends on the circumstances, such as the nature of the goods or services and market conditions."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "18. What is the significance of the 'mirror image rule' in contract acceptance?",
            "The mirror image rule states that acceptance must exactly match the terms of the offer without modifications; any changes constitute a counter-offer rather than an acceptance."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "19. Can acceptance be implied by conduct?",
            "Yes, acceptance can be implied by conduct if such conduct unequivocally indicates acceptance of the offer's terms."
        ),
        ContractFlashCardChapter1(
            "20. What are some examples of situations where an invitation to treat is commonly misunderstood as an offer?",
            "Common examples include advertisements, merchandise displays, catalogues, and price lists, which are typically invitations for customers to make an offer to purchase."
